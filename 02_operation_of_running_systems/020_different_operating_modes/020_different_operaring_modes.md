## Different Operating Modes of a Linux System
A Linux System can be run in **Text Console Mode** and **GUI Mode** if a GUI is installed.
For the pure Terminal Mode the virtual tty (teletype) terminals are used.
Linux systems have 7 virtual terminals: tty1 to tty7.
When booting into a system with a GUI installed some ttys are used to display the GUI, on Ubuntu tty1 shows the display manager is shown, tty2 shows the GUI for the user fist logged in.
To change into terminal mode the remaining ttys can be accessed by pressing `CTRL + ALT + F[3-7]`
