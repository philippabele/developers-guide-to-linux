## Boot Loader Basics
This chapter is based on Chapter 27.4 of Linux - Rheinwerk and the [Ubuntu Documentation](https://wiki.ubuntuusers.de/GRUB_2/Installation/)

The boot loader is placed in the master boot record of a hard drive. Typically a boot loader offers multiple selectable operating systems to start. 
The default boot loader on modern Linux Systems is GRUB2 (GRand Unified Boot Loader2). 

There are other formerly common legacy boot loaders like the Linux Loader (LiLo) or GRUB1 which are not used anymore.
