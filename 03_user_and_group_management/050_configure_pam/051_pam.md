# Pluggable Autentication Modules
This chapter is based on the [Red Hat Documentation](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system-level_authentication_guide/pluggable_authentication_modules).
Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) central way to authenticate. PAMs offer different types of authentication (Kerberos, NIS, local filesystem) and are therefor called pluggable. 

Because of its pluggable nature PAM gives administrators great flexibility on configuring authentication on systems.
PAM can be used by a wide range of applications.

On RedHat Systems the tools `authconfig` or `authselect` are recommended to configure PAM, on Ubuntu the configuration files are edited directly.

The configurations files are `/etc/pam.conf` or any file in `/etc/pam.d` (if `/etc/pam.d` exists `/etc/pam.conf` will be ignored).
Each of these files should consist of multiple rule lines. Each rule-line has a syntax as follows:

```
service type control module-path module-arguments
```
(For files in the `/etc/pam.d` the service field is omitted, instead the name of the file references the service)

## Exercise
- Read the [manpage](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man5/pam.conf.5.html) of *pam.conf* to learn more about the definition of the rules.
