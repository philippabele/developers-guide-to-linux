### Navigating the File System
This section will describe how to find your way through the file system.

#### Useful commands
- `cwd`: The command `cwd` will output the path to the directory you are currently in. 
- `cd`: change your cwd (use .. to get into the directory above the one you are currently in).
  - Useful Shortcuts:
      - `cd -`: change to previous working directory
      - `cd`/`cd ~`: change to your home dir
- `ls`: To see which files are contained by a directory use the command `ls`. Use `ls -l` for more details.
- `file`: `file` will show you the type of a file.
- `less`: use `less` to get a scrollable view of the contents of a text based file.
  - Controls:
    - q: exit
    - /searchstring: replace searchstring with an actual string you are searching for and hit ENTER to search for it.
      - n: next result
    - g: jump to the beginning of the file
    - G: jump to the end of the file
