## Read, and Use System Documentation

Most commands/programs used on Linux offer manpages. Manpages are extensive manuals/documentations of the programs. To access a Programs man page type:

~~~~ bash
man ls
~~~~

The man page can be searched for patterns by typing `/` and the pattern you want to search for, hitting `ENTER` takes you to the first result. You can jump between the results by hitting `n` (next) and `p` (previous).
To exit the man page hit `q`.

## Exercise
- View the manpage for the command `ls` and list the files in the directory in *long format* *recursively* sorted *by time*.
- Lookup the usage of the commands `whereis` and `apropos` which will help you finding commands and exploring the system.
